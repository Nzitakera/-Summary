## Summary
This project uses AI techniques to predict customer behavior based on historical data. It is part of the Building AI course project.


# AI-Powered Prediction Project
## Background
Predicting future outcomes from past data is a common challenge in many fields such as healthcare, finance, and marketing. This project aims to showcase how AI can be used to make accurate predictions and assist in decision-making.

## How it works
- Collect and preprocess historical data
- Train a machine learning model using supervised learning
- Evaluate the model’s performance with test data
- Deploy the model for real-time predictions

## Challenges
- Ensuring data quality and handling missing values
- Avoiding overfitting during model training
- Scaling the solution for large datasets

## What’s next?
- Improve model accuracy using advanced algorithms
- Add visualization dashboards for predictions
- Explore deployment on cloud platforms

## Acknowledgments
